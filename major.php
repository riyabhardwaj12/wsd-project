He explained everyone about his love for that sport. He further added that he has a collection of cricket bats. And one of them is his favorite. When he was young, he use to carry his bat every where with him. When ashwin realised that everyone in the class started getting bored. He decided to switch back the topic. He started speaking about a recent incident that happened at a commercial building, bank near his house. A case of an occurrence of robbery.. Ashwin realised the class started gaining interest, so he switched back to the main topic. He told everyone about the place he loves to go when he is upset. It is a slope near the river basically a bank. Then he started talking about birds and admitted a weird thing. His favorite bird was bat. Everyone was in deep shock. He surprised everyone by talking about his favorite insect, cricket. He later told everyone favorite garments, suit made of very fine texture that was smooth to touch. He told them about the law system and how it was going wrong. He saw police charging a person fine of money for no reason.
